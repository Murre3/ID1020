Collection of solutions to the labs and projects of ID1020 at KTH. Pls don't copy code, you'll learn nothing :(

Maven was used to manage the programs. All code was written in NetBeans with the exception of Project 2 which was written in IntelliJ. Actual code is found in the src-folder. ALl of the tasks are fully solved for max points, except Project 2 which is missing the caching of sub-queries (20p).
